# mlops-hw1

In this project, I tried LakeFS and DVC for data versioning. 

The repository is organized into two primary directories, one for each tool's implementation:

.

├── dvc_workflow/

    ├── MLOPS-HW1-DVC.ipynb       # Jupyter Notebook for the DVC implementation

    └── ...                       # DVC metadata (.dvc), scripts, etc.

│

└── lakefs_workflow/

    ├── MLOPS-HW1-lakeFS.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for the lakeFS implementation
    
    └── ...                       # lakeFS setup files, scripts, etc.
